Greetings from @HaconMagnus!

🌟 Independent freelance Content creator and coder based in the United States.

🚀 Founder CEO of [AiMuscleMedia](https://www.aimusclemedia.com)

🤖 Freelance content creator utilizing AI on self-built equipment. My computer roots go way back, from writing code to building custom hardware. I excel in voiceover work, sound technology, video editing, and production, with a deep affinity for machines. My subject matter spans NSFW, cyborgs, outer space, sci-fi, gore, and horror. My homemade machines give my creations an organic feel. You can support my work directly by tipping on my Twitter profile page or via [GiveSendBro](https://givesendbro.com/AiMuscle). Thank you. 🙏🫂👊

🐧 My other interests include Linux, Python, and hardware hacking.
