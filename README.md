# Greetings from @HaconMagnus

🌌 Visionary coder, AI builder, and creator of SYNTHEON (SYNE) — the token forged in fire, built on Solana, and secured by Magnus Protocol.

🔧 I’m a self-taught hardware hacker, AI integrator, and digital survivalist with a background in retro computing, embedded systems, ethical hacking, and full-stack development. I build, code, automate, and fortify.

🧠 Founder of **AiMuscleMedia** — a one-man think tank engineering intelligent systems, synthetic media, and post-human creative tools using machines built from the bones of discarded tech.

🎧 I create AI-powered voiceovers, ambient dub, soundscapes, and multi-genre music under the alias **RSX**. Tools include analog/digital gear, modular rigs, and homebrew hardware. Expect no fluff — just function and fire.

📡 Longtime Linux user. I work from the CLI. Fluent in Python, Bash, and C with a focus on security, automation, and system control. I design cold storage systems, wearables, and decentralized nodes for the edge-computing future.

🕶️ Interests: Zero-trust architecture, blockchain dev, Raspberry Pi builds, embedded AI, real-world signal processing, rogue hardware ops, and maximizing autonomy.
